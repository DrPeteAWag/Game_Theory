# Overview 
<br>

We begin this section with a review of basic concepts of probability and statistics. In the second part of this section, we use these concepts to extend strategic games as discussed in Section 1 by allowing players to be have different information about their preferences or other aspects of the game, and we explain how to modify the notion of Nash equilibrium to this class of games.

### Preliminaries: Statistics Review

<br>

First, we will be focusing our attention on a review of some basic concepts from probability theory and statistics. To view the videos in full screen, open them in a new tab. 

1. In my first video, I review the notions of probability distributions, discrete and continuous random variables, and expectation.

1. In my second video, I revisit the notion of conditional probability, and Bayes’ rule and  independence.

1. In the third video, I then explain how we use these concepts to incorporate random draws into decision problems, which we will later extend to game theoretic settings.

### Bayesian Games


Now, we will be looking at “Bayesian games” which are strategic games in which players have private information. After a quick detour into some modelling aspects, we look at general definitions and how to solve for equilibria. To view the videos in full screen, open them in a new tab.  

1. In the *first video*, I talk about the notion of “types” which we use to represent the players’ different states of knowledge in strategic games.

2. In the *second video*, I walk you through a first example of a strategic game I call the “meeting game” (which may or may not be inspired by my wife’s weekly meetings with her highly motivated running buddy). The first step is to observe that strategic games with incomplete information are indeed equivalent to extensive games with unobservable actions and moves by Nature. In this sense, the notion of Nash equilibrium that you have seen before can be readily applied. I show you how to find the (pure strategy Nash equilibrium) for this game.

3. The *third video* provides a general definition of Bayesian games and Bayes-Nash equilibrium.

4. The *last two videos* provide further examples of games with incomplete information

   1. **Example 1**:  “More information can be bad”
    
        <p><iframe src="https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=14f193e2-fc0f-4340-8efe-acbb00e9ef2c&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=false&showbrand=false&captions=false&interactivity=all" height="405" width="720" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe></p>

   2. **Example 2**: “Cournot competition with private cost”
   
        <p><iframe src="https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=f78caa58-ebb9-4c5e-9089-acbb00f8eb71&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=false&showbrand=false&captions=false&interactivity=all" height="405" width="720" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe></p>
