The lecture is divided into 6 sections of which 3 are covered in each term. 

### Autumn Term:

**Section 1** looks at strategic games, which are games in which players move simultaneously. We discuss different classes of games, and solution concepts. The first, iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies, is a "minimal" concept that identifies outcomes that could reasonable the construed as potential outcomes of the game that are consistent with rational behavior. Our second solution concept is Nash equilibrium, which are stable choices of actions, in the sense that no player can benefit from deviating. 
<!-- We then extend these notions to mixed strategies. Mixing means that each player, secretly chooses an action at random, for example by throwing a coin, or by choosing randomly in their head.  -->

**Section 2** consider extensive games, which are games in which players choose actions sequentially. There are two main points. First, Nash equilibria of extensive games are the Nash equilibria of their strategic form representations. Second, Nash equilibria in extensive games may contain empty threats. We therefore consider an equilibrium refinement called "Subgame Perfect Equilibrium", which requires a Nash equilibrium of the whole game to be a Nash equilibrium also of each of its subgames. 

**Section 3** discusses a class of games called bargaining games, a type of extensive game, in which players bargain over the division of a "pie". The starting point is a classic and well-known game called "ultimatum game", in which one player makes an offers and the other either accept or rejects. We then discuss the subgame perfect equilibria of the Rubinstein (1979) bargaining model, which is the same as the ultimatum game, but repeated after each rejected offer and with players alternating in making offers. 

### Spring Term

Section 4 considers the possibility of contracts and mediation, to help players coordinate their actions and overcome commitment issues. The most important concept here is the notion of "correlated equilibrium" which one can interpret as a (random) outcome of the game that can be enforced without commitment with the help of a trusted third party. 

Section 5 deals with strategic games with imperfect information, also called "Bayesian Games". The idea is that players enter the game with private information about their own payoffs. For example, a bidder in an auction may have private information about their own preferences for the good being auctioned. 

Finally, in Section 6, we study extensive games with imperfect information. Because proper "subgames" often fail to exist when players have imperfect knowledge about past play, a new concept is needed. We will focus on "weak Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium" (wPBE) which in short consists of the following: (1) a belief at each information set that is consistent with the others' strategies and (2) a strategy that is optimal at each information set given beliefs.
